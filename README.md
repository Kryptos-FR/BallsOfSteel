# Balls of Steel

---

This game was completed in 24 hours as part of a Xenko game jam.

A party brawl game where each player gets control of one spherical fighter. The goal is to get power-ups and kill your friends. The more kills and less deaths you have, the better.

## Controls

The game uses controllers (no keyboard). Left stick is move, right stick is aim and shoot (shoots automatically). A or LT are for jumping, X or RT for a sword attack (assuming Xbox controller).

Any controller plugged in can jump into the game by pressing A (jump). If you get killed, you can respawn by pressing A again.

The game is an endless deathmatch for up to 8 players.

### Stretch goals - nations

When you spawn for the first time you pick a random nation. You can't choose (that's how it work IRL as well).

## What we couldn't do in 24h

### Controls

Your phone is your controller. Contextual buttons will change depending on what actions are available to your character.

We finally got the networking working on a branch, but there wasn't enough time to properly integrate it.

### UI

Because the UI was planned as part of the mobile app we never started working on in-game UI, so there is no way to track the players' hitpoints right now.

### Weapons and power-ups

Rather than picking weapons, the players have both katana and a machine gun always available, and there are no power-ups.

- Katana - slice and dice. Angle of attack matters.

- Machine gun - continuously shoot your enemies from distance.

~~- Shield - good at bashing enemies at close range and bouncing projectiles back~~

~~- Hearts - recover your hearts and get some extra on top of that~~

~~- Power-ups - attack, speed or jump boosts~~
